This is a simple version of the classic game Snake, written in TypeScript and React, with the goal of extending it use a neural network to play the game.

## Running
Clone the repository and run `npm install` to install the dependencies. Then run `npm start` to start the development server.

## Info
The gameboard is zeroed at the top left, with the x-axis increasing to the right and the y-axis increasing downwards. The snake is represented by a list of coordinates, with the head of the snake being the first element in the list. The food is implemented as a list of positions, as we many want to support multiple food items.
